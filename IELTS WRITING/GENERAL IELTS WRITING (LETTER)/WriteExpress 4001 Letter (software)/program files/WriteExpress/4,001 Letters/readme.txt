1. Manual Installation for Microsoft Word
---------------------------------------------------------
For all known solutions, see http://www.WriteExpress.com/faq.html

If 4,001 Business, Sales & Personal Letters does not appear on the Add-In menu in Microsoft Word 2007 or the Tools menu in previous versions of Word then setup was not able to correctly install its file for Microsoft Word.

Solution: Find the Startup folder under the folder where winword.exe is installed. Locate and copy file writex32.wll to that folder. If you installed Rhymer (which was installed by default), locate and copy Rhymer.wll to that folder too.

Technical Explanation: 4,001 Business, Sales & Personal Letters for Word is a WLL (Word link library) file. Its file writex32.wll must be installed in Word's startup folder. When Word starts, it loads all the .wll files it finds in its startup folder. When 4,001 Business & Sales Letters loads, it retrieves the path of its database from the Windows registry and loads its letter-writing categories and topics.

For Windows Vista:
4,001 Business, Sales & Personal Letters retrieves the path to its database from the WriteExpress.ini file, which gets installed in Word's STARTUP folder. Using Notepad or a text editor, open WriteExpress.ini file in Word's STARTUP folder. If the file does not exist then create it.

Write the following and save the file:

[4001]
DataPath=C:\Program Files\WriteExpress\4,001 Letters

(or the path that you installed the files to)
